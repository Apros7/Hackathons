## 1: Diabetes overview and summarize WDF efforts (2 min)

- How is diabetes evolving in the world?
    - [x] Total diabetes patients
    - [x] Future estimates (also region based) (propertion)
    - [ ] Yearly diagnosed
    - [ ] Yearly undiagnosed

- How does the healthcare landscape look in LMICs?
    - [ ] Region specific (Yearly diagnosed, yearly undiagnosed)
    - [x] Largest LMICs (dollars per person spent on diabetes)
    - [x] High impact LMICs (dollars per person spent on diabetes)
    - [x] Indian healthcare landscape (hypertension, obesity)

- What have the effects of WDF been in the last two decades?
    - [x] Basic information about WDF
    - [x] Total projects & total spent (over time)
    - [x] Indian projects and spent

->

## 2: Our solution (5 min)

- Dollars per year of life saved (over time from beginning of WDF)
- Dollars per death avoided

Given place of project, return 
- Estimated amount of dollars spend per year of life saved (heatmap)

Based on various inputs, return estimated score of potential partner

1.
- [ ] Dollars per diagnosed (death, blind, amputated, ...)
    - Eveyr project find dollars used and patients diagnosed (type 1)
    - create heatmap
    - create metric over time
- [ ] AI: 
    - ICMR dataset predict diabetes (+ undiagnosed) levels from hypertension and obecity
        - given diagnosed, return undiagnosed
    - Based on diabetes procentage (maybe something else) and population size, return 
- [ ] 

2. Estimated future sales (and people saved) for NN per dollar invested in WDF
- [ ] NN investment in WDF
- [ ] WDF patients diagnosed
- [ ] NN percentage sales of all sales
- [ ] Up until now NN increase in sales because of WDF
- [ ] Estimation function for future delivery
